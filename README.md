### Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m [**Pedrocas**](https://www.instagram.com/fpedrocas), a Portuguese Content Creator, Software Developer, Translator, and Side Quest Seeker.

I consider myself a Creator. I love bringing ideas to life regardless of medium, be it Coding, Video, Music, or whatever it is - creating is my ultimate passion.

Whenever I have problem, I look for a solution. When there isn't one that fits my needs, well, I might just build it.  

I'm a huge self-hoster and supporter of open-source, and I use FOSS tools whenever possible.
Some of my favorite FOSS projects are: [Immich](https://github.com/immich-app), [Jellyfin](https://github.com/jellyfin), and [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant) 

#### Fun Facts:

* I have a cat called Chibi

* I (barely) play guitar
* Code Lyoko is the show of my childhood and I'm a die-hard fan
* Bacalhau é m*rda
* Reality is an illusion, the universe is a hologram, buy gold. Bye!
